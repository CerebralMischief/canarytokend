by Thinkst Applied Research

Overview
--------
An example daemon that tails log files and fires Canarytoken alerts based on regular expressions.

Useful for retrofitting Canarytokens into an existing server setup where logs are in place and you want to be notified of specific events.

Modular and low effort.
